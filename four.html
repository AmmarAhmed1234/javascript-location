    <h1><strong>Length[edit]</strong><br>
        See also: List of longest novels
        The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the novella, short story, and flash fiction. However, in the 17th century critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the "totality of life."[10]
        The length of a novel can still be important because most literary awards use length as a criterion in the ranking system.[note 2]</h1>
